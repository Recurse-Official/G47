# SHARING SURPLUS

## Introduction
*Sharing Surplus* is a revolutionary platform dedicated to reducing food waste and combating hunger by redistributing surplus food from donors to those in need. We connect businesses and individuals with surplus food to orphanages, shelters, and food banks.

## Vision
We envision a world where no one goes hungry and food waste is a thing of the past. Our goal is to create a sustainable food system that supports communities and preserves our environment.

## How It Works
1. *Partnerships:* We partner with restaurants, grocery stores, and other food providers.
2. *Donation Process:* Donors use our platform to list available surplus food.
3. *Matching:* We match the donations with receivers in need, such as orphanages and shelters.
4. *Delivery:* Volunteers or logistics partners ensure the food is safely delivered.

## Features
- *User-Friendly Interface:* Simple process for both donors and receivers.
- *Real-Time Updates:* Track the status of donations in real time.
- *Safety and Quality:* Adherence to strict safety guidelines to ensure all food is fresh and safe for consumption.
- *Community Engagement:* Engage with a community of donors, volunteers, and organizations.
